<tr><td>implementation</td><td>INTEGER</td><td>
This test was given in two different implementations. 
<br/><br/>
In implementation one (1), after taking the test subjects were asked for age and gender (see field "age" and "gender") and if they had given accurate answers to the test and if their answers could be used. Subject not answering yes to the last question were discarded.
<br/><br/>
In implementation two (2), after taking the test users were directed to answer on a scale how accurate their answers were (see field "accuracy"). How long the user took to take the test was also recorded in this implementation (see field "elaspe").
